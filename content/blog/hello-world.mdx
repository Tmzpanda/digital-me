Welcome to my corner of the internet.

## Why I Started This Blog

I've always believed that writing is thinking. By putting thoughts into words, we clarify our own understanding and perhaps help others along the way.

This blog will cover a range of topics:

- **科技 (Tech)**: Deep dives into data engineering, cloud architecture, and emerging technologies
- **投资 (Investment)**: Thoughts on markets, valuations, and long-term thinking
- **世界观 (Worldview)**: How systems work, from economics to geopolitics
- **人 (People)**: Stories and lessons from the people who inspire me

## What to Expect

I'll aim to write pieces that I would want to read myself - thoughtful, well-researched, and honest. Some posts will be technical tutorials, others will be essays exploring ideas.

Stay tuned.
