## About
Hi, I'm Tim! 👋 I'm a software engineer with 5 years of experience in big data development, meanwhile I'm a Google Cloud certified professional cloud architect, data engineer and machine learning engineer.

I got lucky to work in excellent teams and learned valuable skills.
- Build distributed data platforms that manage large-scale data throughout the entire lifecycle, from collection, processing to storage and serving, to help teams make data-driven decisions and develop data products.
- Build and maintain scalable infrastructure, leveraging IaC tools, containerization technologies, and monitoring, logging, tracing tools.
- Build applications with microservices architecture, implement RPC/REST APIs, event-driven systems, interact with relational/NoSQL databases.
- Implement DevOps best practices, build CI/CD workflows to automate build, test, and deployment.
- Build, train, deploy and serve AI/ML models.
- Collaborate with cross-functional teams, align on the goals and implement technical solutions.

Besides all that, I'm a quite friendly person. I believe that relationships last beyond the job. Feel free to reach out if I can help.
